# Abstract
In this project I will be using movie data to predict movie ratings. I will be using a dataset of 45,000 movies along with characteristics such as genre, director, and cast and the average IMDB rating the movie received. As we are predicting a rating which is a continuous variable (1 to 10), this is a regression problem. I will be using a variety of regression models to predict the ratings and will be comparing their performance. The predictor variables will be the characteristics of the movie and the target variable will be the IMDB rating. Model success will be measured using the mean absolute error between the predicted and actual rating as a proximity score.

# Motivation and Question
The motivation for this project is to explore the relationship between movie characteristics and their ratings. I am interested in understanding how different factors such as genre, director, and cast influence the ratings a movie receives. The question I am trying to answer is: "Can we accurately predict a movie's IMDB rating based on its characteristics?" As a movie enthusiast, I am very interested in understanding what makes a movie successful and how we can use data to predict its success. I believe that this project will not only help me learn more about regression models but also provide valuable insights into the movie industry. The data I will be using can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) and contains information about 45,000 movies including their titles, genres, directors, cast, and average IMDB ratings along with metadata like budget and other features. 

# Planned Deliverables
This project will include a few different deliverables including the python packages for the models that I will be using, a Jupyter notebook with code and analysis using the packages to analyze the data, and a report summarizing my findings. I will also include visualizations of the data to help illustrate my points. A "full success" for this project would be to create multiple models that can accurately predict a movie's IMDB rating based on its characteristics and be able to compare and contrast the performance of these models. I would also like to be able to provide insights into which characteristics are most important in predicting a movie's rating and how they interact with each other. A "partial success" would be to create at least one model that can accurately predict a movie's IMDB rating and provide some insights into the data. Regardless of the outcome, the final report will include a summary of my findings and any challenges I faced during the project that may have impacted the success of the project.

# Resources Required
As mentioned above, I have access to a dataset of 45,000 movies and their characteristics that can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset). Since the data is accounted for, I will not need any more resources. I will be using Python and Jupyter notebooks to analyze the data and create the models. I will also be using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn to help with the analysis and modeling.

# What You Will Learn
I hope to learn about the strengths and weaknesses of different regression models and how they can be used to predict a continuous variable. I also hope to learn more about the movie industry and what factors influence a movie's success. The dream would be to be able to use the learnings from this model as I interact with the movie industry in the future. If I can gain a better sense of what makes good movies, I can use that knowledge when deciding which movies to watch. My improved understanding of regression models will also help me in my future studies and career as I will be able to apply these techniques to other datasets and problems.
