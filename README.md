# Abstract
In this project I will be using movie data to predict movie ratings. I will be using a dataset of 45,000 movies along with characteristics such as genre, director, and cast and the average IMDB rating the movie received. As we are predicting a rating which is a continuous variable (1 to 10), this is a regression problem. I will be using a variety of regression models to predict the ratings and will be comparing their performance. The predictor variables will be the characteristics of the movie and the target variable will be the IMDB rating. Model success will be measured using the mean absolute error between the predicted and actual rating as a proximity score.

# Motivation and Question
The motivation for this project is to explore the relationship between movie characteristics and their ratings. I am interested in understanding how different factors such as genre, director, and cast influence the ratings a movie receives. The question I am trying to answer is: "Can we accurately predict a movie's IMDB rating based on its characteristics?" As a movie enthusiast, I am very interested in understanding what makes a movie successful and how we can use data to predict its success. I believe that this project will not only help me learn more about regression models but also provide valuable insights into the movie industry. The data I will be using can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) and contains information about 45,000 movies including their titles, genres, directors, cast, and average IMDB ratings along with metadata like budget and other features.
